apoidea
=======

ATENTION!!! THIS IS OLD CODE FROM 2005 AND I AM STILL REVEWING IT!!! THERE ARE KNOWN BUGS AND SECURITY ISSUES!!!

Apoidea is a Backoffice Generator. It's a python script that reads data schema from an xml, and creates a mySQL and a complete PHP CRUD backoffice. I know, crazy, right?

This is a old project (2005), and I am updating it to more recent versions of software, before commiting to github. Back in those days, there weren't much MVC frameworks around that were worth it, so this was really helpful. Now it will be here just for history. Maybe someone will find some use for it.
